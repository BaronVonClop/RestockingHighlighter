            <h1>Restocking Highlighter</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Neopets restocking highlighter script. This script will assist you with setting up a
                restocking highlighter. What that will do is enable you to view Neopets stores and have all the profitable
                items highlighted. <b>This is not an autobuyer.</b> You still do all of the restocking and purchasing
                yourself, but with the ability to make instant, snap decisions with much less risk.</p>
            <p>You can input a list of items copy/pasted from NeoCodex. JellyNeo works too, but generally Codex
                will function better and be more accurate.</p>
            <p><b>You must be using Chrome with the Tampermonkey extension installed.</b> Allegedly, using Firefox
                and Greasemonkey works as well, but I don't use either.</p>

                <h3>What's the point of this?</h3>
                <p>This allows you to view a shop and immediately know what items are very likely to be profitable.
                 You no longer need to guess and hope that what you are buying is valuable.</p>
                <h3>Why not just use an autobuyer/automater/other cheating software?</h3>
                <p>Autobuyers and any automated software are detectable by TNT. They make predictable, machine-like
                decisions and motions, which can be seen and detected by TNT, resulting in a permanent account ban.
                On the other hand, this is 100% client side and never interacts with TNT servers, and uses your own human
                movements and motions. This means that it is completely undetectable; as far as anyone on TNT can tell,
                you are just a very skilled restocker, same as any other.</p>
                <h3>Is this guaranteed to work?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. It is only as accurate as NeoCodex's database is, which while <i>usually</i> fine,
                can be inaccurate sometimes. The risk is extremely small, however. At worst, you are out a trivial amount
                of NP. The gains from successful attempts are far, far, far greater than the losses from mistakes.</p>
